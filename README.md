## Technical Overview
Implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and best practices to enhance the project's design, maintainability, and scalability. Applied Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) methodologies to ensure a modular and structured architecture. Utilized the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern along with other industry-standard design patterns to promote separation of concerns and improve code reusability. Adhered to software engineering best practices, including proper naming conventions, code readability, and extensibility. This project demonstrates my proficiency in OOP, software architecture, and designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications.
